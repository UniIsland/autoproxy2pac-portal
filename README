Description

This is still a prototype for autoproxy2pac-portal.
Set up a simple portal page to autoproxy2pac on any public accessible site.
Main purpose of this project is to make autoproxy2pac unblockable by the GFW.
So I'll keep this project lightweight and easy to implement.


Install

Just copy the "autoproxy.php" file to a server that have access to autoproxy2pac.appspot.com.

And everything is done. 
Then tell others about your portal by setting up a link to it somewhere.
You are free to rename the file (keep the .php extension though),
and put it into any sub-directory of your site.
